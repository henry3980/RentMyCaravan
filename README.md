# RentMyCaravan
A public resting place for our uni web development module coursework - hopefully someone finds it useful.

Built with HTML / PHP / CSS and pure love - this is a management system for a fictional caravan
rental company. Designed soley to allow the users(caravan owners) to manage listings of their own caravans.

Known flaws:
- homepage runs database queries on every load - this was a demo feature and would be cached in a production enviroment
- Login system isn't that secure, if you are actually building something like this for use: please consider using SSO / learning
how to build secure systems
- site can be glitchy due to the PHP not having *much* error handling, again this was due to it being a demo product

Demo account included in the .sql: 
Username: test
